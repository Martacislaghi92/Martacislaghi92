👀 I’m interested in marketing, web development, and SEO.
After years of working in IT ERP consulting, I discovered a new passion: marketing. This passion led me to delve into web development, where I found a true calling.

🌱 I’m currently learning web development
Although I am new to web development, I am enthusiastic about learning and applying my knowledge to build and optimize websites and applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on custom web projects and SEO optimization
I'm always looking for opportunities to develop personalized projects, build my portfolio, and eventually transition into freelancing.
